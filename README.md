Scientific Question: Is it possible to visually identify between the American Alligator and the American Crocodile quickly? | Scientific Hypothesis: If there are defining features to the head shape appearance between the American Alligator and the American Crocodile, then their images can be classified in an automated process.

You will need the following image datasets to use in unison with the code.

1) "Alligator" Image Dataset
2) "Crocodile" Image Dataset

These images can be obtained from Google Drive using this link and downloading the folders: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1STqrl1SqPyngqcwTH-zEvm_5_JXBoOjK?usp=sharing.
If for whatever reason the link does not work, zipped versions of the images are available in the main directory which can be downloaded and unzipped for use in the code.

How to use the dataset in the code:

IMPORTANT: Please run line 2 first before proceeding with the images. Line 2 will create a directory in Juypter Notebook called "reptile_data" and two folders within it named "alligators" and "crocodiles". Manually upload the images to the respective folders and in Juypter Notebook, you may need to press upload for each image to download. 

After this, run the code normally and the model will create directories and shuffle images on its own, but it will need your help with uploading the source images initially with the above instructions.
